DNA Sequence Analyzer ðŸ§¬  
This Python script counts the occurrences of nucleotides (A, T, C, G) in a given DNA sequence.  

Why I Built This  
I'm exploring the intersection of AI and bioinformatics. While Iâ€™m still learning coding, this project is a step toward understanding how AI can analyze genetic data.  

Future Plans  
- Expand it to analyze larger DNA sequences  
- Implement machine learning to detect patterns in genetic data
